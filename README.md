### Directory Organizer

We all have that folder in our computer which contains all the types of files scattered in one place. We want to organize then but it takes hell lot of time to cut/paste files to respective folders, which is not even fun to do. This shell script will help to manage your files. 
This is a simple shell script to organize and clean your unmanaged directory to sort and move the files into their respected directories. This will put all the similar files in one directory/folder (in the current directory).

#### Usage
- Git clone this repo.
- ```chmod +x organizer.sh```
- ```./organizer.sh /path/to/your/messed/folder/```

##### or
Copy the organizer file to the messed up directory. Then
```./organizer.sh```
will do the work.


_Any improvements is appriciated Thank you._
